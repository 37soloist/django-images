h1. django-images

Unlike other popular thumbnailing solutions, this one will keep information about existing thumbnails in the database. This is crucial for external storages where checking for file's existence can either cost significant amounts of time or money (think Amazon S3).

h2. Updating from django-images <= 0.3

django-images database schema have been changed in 0.4 release. To accomodate
existing installations south migrations have been provided.

When updating an existing installation to 0.4, migrations have to be synced
with database. It can be done by doing:
@$ python manage.py migrate django_images 0001 --fake@
@$ python manage.py migrate django_images@
